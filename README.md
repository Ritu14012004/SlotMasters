## üñåÔ∏è Design Decisions

### Component-Based Architecture:
The project follows a modular, component-based structure using React. Each feature (e.g., Interview Scheduler, Interview Dashboard, etc.) is implemented as a separate component for easier scalability and maintenance.

### State Management:
Zustand is used to manage global application state. This approach provides a simple, scalable way to handle global states such as scheduled interviews and user data.

### UI/UX:
The UI is simple, clean, and user-friendly, with a focus on accessibility. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, providing a responsive and modern design, while React Toastify gives real-time feedback to users.

### Time Management:
Time slots are handled with a custom date picker to avoid overlaps and ensure that interview scheduling is precise. The app prevents users from selecting invalid time slots, ensuring a seamless experience.

### Notifications:
React Toastify is used for providing immediate feedback to users. Notifications are shown when an interview is successfully scheduled or when any errors occur.
## üßÆ Challenges Faced

- **Handling Conflicting Slots:** Ensuring that time slots selected by one user do not overlap with others required managing interview slots efficiently.
- **Date and Time Formatting:** Handling different time formats and managing time zones was challenging, especially with user inputs from multiple regions.
- **State Synchronization:** Managing global state across multiple components (like interviews, candidates, and interviewers) required careful handling to avoid data inconsistencies.
- **Error Handling & User Feedback:** Providing meaningful notifications for different scenarios (e.g., conflicting interview schedules, successful scheduling) required careful attention to ensure smooth user interactions.
